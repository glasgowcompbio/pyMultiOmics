# pyMultiOmics

pyMultiOmics is a Python package for multi-omics data integration and analysis. 
It uses the Reactome database to map entities (genes, transcripts, proteins, compounds) to
their reactions and pathways. The results is then shown as a network graph. Various analyses such as
differential analysis, pathway activity analysis can be performed on this network graph, with the results 
overlaid on the graph.
